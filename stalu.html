        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Sta. Lucia High School is a public secondary school located in Pasig City, Philippines. It was officially established on June 19, 1994, through Republic Act 7767. The school initially operated with a 24-room building, which was inaugurated on March 10, 1998. It opened for the academic year 1998-1999 with 1,086 students and a faculty of 34 teachers, supported by five non-teaching staff.
            Over the years, the school expanded significantly due to increasing student enrollment. Additional buildings were constructed with the support of the Pasig City government and the Department of Education. In 2007, a new 1.4-hectare campus was acquired, and a 34-room building was constructed to accommodate more students. The school has continued to develop its facilities to enhance the quality of education it provides.
            Sta. Lucia High School offers both Junior and Senior High School programs, including various academic tracks under the K-12 curriculum. It has a strong academic reputation, consistently performing well in national assessments and competitions. The school is under the jurisdiction of the Schools Division Office of Pasig City and operates with the motto "LUCIANS, Magaling at Disiplinado" (Lucians, Excellent and Disciplined)​</p>
